### Progress

In this laboritory work a big refactor was made. First of all, the simulation was rewritten in Java from Kotlin, secondly the whole simulation was written from scratch, a lot of new classes as `Tile`, `Move` and many more was added, as well as the classes which represents the MVC pattern, with which the simulation operates.
